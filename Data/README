The Data can be downloaded from the dropbox link. 
There are three sets of data, the details of which are explained below:

AFFINITY MATURATION SIMULATION DATA (in the folder AM_RAW_DATA)
The data files have following name formats, which contains information about the simulation condition:
(1) chimeric/cocktailExplicit_rho_00_E0_00_X_00_f_00.mat:
	rho - antigenic distance; E0 - initial affinity; X - Stringency of T cell help; f - fraction of T cell epitopes shared
	MATLAB data files containing the results of the simulation.

ANALYSIS DATA (in the folder BNAB_FRACTION)
The data files have following name formats:
(1) chimeric/cocktail_bnAb_fraction_rho00.csv:
	Each row contains the fraction of GC B cells that are RBS-directed.
	Row 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to X=0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5 respectively
(2) chimeric/cocktail_bnAb_crossreactive_rho00.csv:
	Each row contains the fraction of RBS-directed B cells that are cross-reactive.
	Row 1, 2, 3, 4 corresponds to X=0.4, 0.6, 1.0, 1.5 respectively

ANTIGEN EXTRACTION DATA (in the zip file ANTIGEN_EXTRACTION)
The data files have following name formats:
(1) Antigen0_E1-00_E2-00_E3-00_R0120_L0120
	Antigen2 - Chimera, Antigen3 - Cocktail; E1,E2,E3 - Affinity of B cell; 
	R0,L0(fixed) - B cell receptor and antigen number in immune synnapse
