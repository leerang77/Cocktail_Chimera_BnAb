This folder contains MATLAB codes that are used to simulate the antigen capture by B cells at the B cell-FDC interface. 

runClusterExtract.m is used with appropriate parameters to run the simulations. ClusterExtract.m is a helper function.

Affinity2Agcaptured.m is used to analyze the simulated data to derive affinity-antigen captured relationship. analyzeAgCaptured.m is a helper function.
