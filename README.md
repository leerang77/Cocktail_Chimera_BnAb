# Cocktail_Chimera_BnAb

This repository contains original code and data created for the study titled "T helper cells select germinal center B cells stringently to promote the evolution of cross-reactive influenza antibodies" by Yang, Caradonna, Schmidt, and Chakraborty. 

There are three folders, each containing
(1) Code and data for simulations of antigen capture by B cells at the FDC-B cell immune interface
(2) Code and data for simulations of affinity maturation, upon immunization with cocktail or chimeric antigen
(3) Code for the analysis of the data
